MR. ALONSO
(happily)
Ah, there you are! Thank you so much for helping me out with the VIRIDOS project! The past few nights have been, uh, kinda busy as we scrambled to get this prototype ready, but now we're...somewhat confident in it. Let me show you how it works.

Tutorial of VIRIDOS mechanics play

CUT TO:
ext. oxford Academy
VIRDOS is heading towards the English Building. VIRIDOS begins telling the history of Oxford while moving.

VIRIDOS
Welcome, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us today. Oxford Academy is a Gold Ribbon School and a National Blue Ribbon School. It is ranked #2 in California and #19 in the nation by the US News and World Report in 2020. Please keep your hands, arms, feet and legs, inside your house while the robot is movi-

VIRIDOS suddenly glitches out and makes a sharp turn towards the Rosa Parks mural, smashing into it multiple times.

TRANSITION TO:
ext. english building, rosa parks mural

MR. ALONSO
(via transmission, visibly confused)
That...shouldn't happen. I swear I programmed it on a straight path... Could you take a look to see what's wrong?

>**_PUZZLE #1 (VIRIDOS Glitch)_**
[[need to insert something to indicate user has gotten hint from HOSHI solving puzzle 1]]

CUT TO:
ext. english building, rosa parks mural

MR. ALONSO
(via transmission)
Well that's odd[[in reference to hint gained in Puzzle #1]], give it to VIRIDOS to hold for now. Hopefully that's just a one-off glitch hehe, let's continue the test.

TRANSITION TO:
ext. oxford academy, portables and field

VIRIDOS continues the tour, now heading up the right side of the English building towards the portables and the field. VIRIDOS tells about the biomed pathway and athletics.

VIRIDOS
Oxford is dedicated to career success as seen through our pathway programs. Here our biomed pathway takes its classes. Up ahead is our athletic facilities where our soccer field, baseball field, softball field, track, and...track...are...loca-

VIRIDOS glitches again and makes a sharp 180 turn, banging into the Rosa Parks mural once more.

TRANSITION TO:
ext. english building, rosa parks mural

MR. ALONSO
(via transmission)
Huh, back here again? ...that's odd...there's some transmission sending data directly to the robot! No-one else should have access to control it... and why would they bring it here...? (short pause of confusion, then snaps back) A-Anyway, why don't you go and fix the robot.

>**_PUZZLE #2 (VIRIDOS Glitch 2)_**
[[again must indicate somehow that user gained another clue to HOSHI cia Puzzle #2]]

CUT TO:
ext. english building, rosa parks mural

MR. ALONSO
(via transmission)
Huh I've never seen these before[[in reference to hint gained from Puzzle #2]], this is so weird. Have VIRIDOS take a look. Anyways, its programming looks good now, hopefully that's the last of any technical difficulties.

TRANSITION TO:
ext. oxford academy, world languages building

VIRIDOS continues the tour once again now giving information about the world languages at Oxford.

VIRIDOS
Here at Oxford we offer both Spanish and Korean languages. Students take a Cultures and Conversations course in 7th grade to experience both-

VIRIDOS glitches again, now sputtering gibberish in Spanish and Korean

TRANSITION TO:
ext. oxford academy, rosa parks mural

VIRIDOS beelines for the Rosa Parks mural and slams into it again.

MR. ALONSO
(in confused annoyance)
Gosh darn robot, why won't you work!? There's gotta be something else wrong, I've checked the code 5 times now! Check the wall for anything odd...maybe there's some interference. Or what if...do you still have those, uh, things, from earlier?

[[add camera movements after puzzles are finalized]]

>**_PUZZLE #3 (Rosa Parks Mural)_**

Upon completing the puzzle, the mural wall opens up, revealing a compartment. The communicator starts glitching out.

MR. ALONSO
(constantly cutting out)
Wait! By connection's breaking up! What's going on?! I can't see!

The connection goes to static. Inside the compartment is a futuristic-looking shrine. On it is a beaten up composition notebook.

TRANSITION TO:
int. rosa parks mural shrine

Upon a quick a flip through, PLAYER realizes that certain pages are torn out of the book. VIRIDOS glitches again, this time a voice different from VIRIDOS's default is heard. The communicator displays a dark silhouette with a computer-distorted voice. This is HOSHI REPRESENTATIVE.

HOSHI REPRESENTATIVE
*To whoever finds this...we cannot let Whitney uncover the findings to Project Emerald. We have scattered the most important pieces of research throughout the school. If you are reading this, find the research...it is imperative in order to conquer the Whitney Wildcats. We will be there with you don't worry, just continue your current tour test...HOSHI out*

CUT TO:
ext. oxford academy, rosa parks mural shrine

MR. ALONSO
(via transmission)
Hello? Hello?? Ah finally I've got connection again. I uh don't know what went wrong there hehe you know technology these days, but it seems like I have things under control finally. So *before* the robot started glitching, we were going to the English building. Let's continue the tour there. Gosh I've got a lot of work to do on the programming...

VIRIDOS starts moving into the English building.

TRANSITION TO:
i/e oxford academy, english building

VIRIDOS continues the tour into the Oxford English Building.

VIRIDOS
This is our newest building, the English building. Not only are English classes taught here, but also our yearbook, ASB, and our school newspaper the Gamut meet in these classrooms as well.

MRS. FONG pokes her head out of her classroom, clearly in need of help, interjecting the current tour.

MRS. FONG
Hey, do you mind helping me with a quick problem I have?

TRANSITION TO:
int. english classroom (fong)

The classroom appears normal, except for a few books scattered. MRS. FONG stands in the middle of the classroom looking perplexed.

MRS. FONG
Hey, welcome to my classroom! Good thing you stopped by; my notes for *Of Mice and Men* were scrambled for some reason. Can you help me with this?

>**_PUZZLE #4 (English Puzzle)_**

[[PLAYER gets page 1 of composition book]]

CUT TO:
int. english classroom (fong)

MRS. FONG
Thank you! Now I can continue with my lesson prep. Have a nice day!

HOSHI REPRESENTATIVE
(via transmission)
*Good, I've seen you've found out how we did our clues. You will continue to see this throughout the day; it's all part of the plan. Just continue your tour.*

>**Fade to black**

 [[write in Puzzles 4-7 (first 4 teacher visits) once puzzles are finalized]]

TRANSITION TO:
int. science hall, moving towards exit

VIRIDOS suddenly stops.

MR. ALONSO
Uh oh, what's goi--

The lights black out as the communicator and rest of the robot shut off, leaving a completely black screen. A light pulses on screen, saying "Using Emergency Power". The other HUD items fade in slowly, but now are more stripped down and "dark" in terms of design (more akin to a terminal look than a full GUI). The communicator plays static as the HOSHI REPRESENTATIVE hacks into it again.

HOSHI REPRESENTATIVE
(holding back panic)
*...Look, something is wrong. We picked some strange signals fetching data from the robot. The IP address traces to Whitney. We think they're on your trail. It is _imperative_ that you find the pages and find them quick. Go to classroom 30C[[303]]. Be careful.*

>**_PUZZLE 8 (Blackout Puzzle)_**
[[goal of this puzzle is to penalize those that have been randomly clicking]]

Map of 300 building is displayed with the instructions "go to classroom 30**C**". Most of the rooms have 360Â° photos, but have nothing of interest (and the instructions don't disappear unless in 303). Classroom 303 has an obvious sheet of paper left by HOSHI on the ground. Clicking on it triggers the next cutscene.

[[Puzzles 9-12]]

CUT TO:
ext. oxford Academy, quad

PLAYER receives page from custodian puzzle. Suddenly, the communicator glitches as a WHITNEY REPRESENTATIVE appears. Still a silhouette, but with a gradient yellow and black background.

WHITNEY REPRESENTATIVE
(devilishly)
*We know who you are and what you're after. You will not succeed. Whitney will reign number 1! Stop now...or else...(pause)...we know where you are...*

Using IP address, WHITNEY REPRESENTATIVE identifies the player's real life location. The communicator glitches again as HOSHI REPRESENTATIVE hacks back in.

HOSHI REPRESENTATIVE
(with urgency)
*Hurry! They're onto us! You must find the rest of the research before it's too late! I'm sorry, I can't help you anymore until you find the rest of the pages; this connection just isn't safe anymore. The fate of our rankings is in your hands. I'll leave you with one last hint.*

>**_PUZZLE 13 (Morse Code)_**

[[Puzzle 14-15]]

CUT TO:
ext. oxford academy, quad

Player has completed the missing research and is assembling the pages. A cryptic poem appears.

>**_PUZZLE 16 (Project Emerald Cryptic Clue)_**

The message that emerges from Puzzle 16 is "Look by the stairs near the elevator".

TRANSITION TO:
ext. oxford academy, science stairwell by elevator

Camera pans towards metal opening to secret room.

>**_PUZZLE 17 (The Final Puzzle)_**

TRANSITION TO:
int. science stairwell by elevator

Camera pans to show the green polo sitting majestically in the center of the room. HOSHI REPRESENTATIVE now provides the history of Project Emerald.

HOSHI REPRESENTATIVE
*And there you have it, the glorious Green Polo, the results of Project Emerald. Our studies have shown that students who wear this polo are guaranteed to be the best Oxford student. You have clearly proven yourself worthy of the green polo through your efforts to thwart Whitney from getting possesion of our coveted product. Thank you for everything, make us proud, go Patriots. HOSHI out*

The communicator then comes online again with Mr. Alonso exasperated and relieved after finally figuring out how to reconnect with it.

MR. ALONSO
There you are, finally my systems are back online! What on earth has VIRIDOS gone through?? *sigh*, I guess I've got a lot of re-programming to do. Thank you for your help again, can't imagine what this poor robot's been through...

>Fade to Black

Final credits and leaderboard is shown. If this is the first place winner, maybe a video from Ms. Houston explains the green polo prize.
